I just thought that I would build out a GitHub Pages site as a bit of a bio page but also to capture any ramblings that I feel like making... I promise not to get to political or technical and more celebrate things that I am interested in or thinking.

---------
## Personal Bio
I was born/grew up in a small country town in South Gippsland, Victoria Australia called Leongatha [Map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Leongatha+VIC+3953/@-38.472043,145.9417539,13z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x6b2a272e74bc8381:0x40579a430a06260).
Both of my parents were school teachers with mum being primary (grade 1-6) and dad Tech School Maths/Sci (year 11-12) and Tafe (Tertiary and Further Education) and some of my fondest memories as a kid are walking the halls of Leongatha Tech and checking out the computer room. At the time they had some awesome tape drives and I marvelled at the 8inch Floppy Drive Disks ([something like this](http://boginjr.com/it/hw/8inch-drives/)).

## Markdown Guide
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/benksmillie/benksmillie/edit/master/docs/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/benksmillie/benksmillie/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
